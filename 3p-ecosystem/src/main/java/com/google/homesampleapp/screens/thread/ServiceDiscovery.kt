/**
 * Service discovery for Thread Border Routers
 *
 * This method starts the discovery of Thread Border Router services, identified by the
 * [threadBorderRouterServiceType]. Service discovery will *only* find devices in the same network
 * partition or subnet, such as we find on a home or SMB. Once there is a router in between
 * partitions on complex network topologies, such as corporate networks, the multicasts will not
 * traverse them, and you'll not be able to see devices beyond the router.
 *
 * The exception to the rule is the Thread Border Router, which will expose the Thread devices in
 * the Thread Network, which register using the Service Registration Protocol (SRP)
 *
 * Once the service (device) is found, it is resolved by the [ResolveListener], which will add the
 * device information to the list of [resolvedDevices]. A list is used here (and not a map) because
 * it makes the iteration easier when user selects a BR in the pop up dialog
 *
 * This set has rich service information, such as IP addresses and several TXT fields. See more
 * information about the [threadBorderRouterServiceType] on
 * https://developers.home.google.com/thread#border_agent_discovery
 *
 * You'll find similar mDNS/Service Discovery usage, but for Matter devices, on
 * screens/commissionable/mdns. Matter has its own specific libraries that encapsulate nsdManager
 * and Matter-specific mDNS/SD code
